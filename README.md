**Survive Line** is a game powered by Pygame and Artificial Intelligence, designed as my BSc thesis project. In this game, a ball navigates between two waves where they have random amplitude and the speed between them decreases over time, powered by the latest in AI technology using the N.E.A.T algorithm.

## Features

- **Dynamic Waves:** Experience the changing waves as you play more.
- **AI-Driven:** The ball is controlled by an AI trained using the N.E.A.T algorithm. It managed to play continuously for 30 min
- **High Performance:** The game runs at a 120fps providing smooth gameplay.

## AI Features

The game features an AI that can autonomously navigate through the waves without any manual intervention. Below is a video showcasing the AI in action
