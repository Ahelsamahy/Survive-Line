\begin{abstract}
	It is about the process of starting the game in an idea, to laying it down to be an actual project that can run, it will be separated into main 3 section, the first one is the wave class, second is ball and third is combine the game altogether in the main class
\end{abstract}

Choosing python as a programming language had a lots of good options in it:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Most of AI libraries are made in python
	\item The numbers start at 1 with each use of the \texttt{enumerate} environment.
	\item Another entry in the list
\end{enumerate}


the first step of the game was was to generate a wave and duplicate it on both sides of the screen, not to be hard-codded as the game is made to be infinite function that can generate a wave for me and at the same time i can change in the variables of  wave to make it harder for the players, these variable are 
the wave amplitude\footnote{is the maximum or lowest height the wave can go in one point to up or down} or 
the wave frequency\footnote{ number of waves that can go through a fixed distance in amount of time} 
with all of this in calculation, it means that i can make the game harder by making the behaviour unexpected for the next move, also to go extra step, the wave will decrees the gap between each other to limit the player movement
