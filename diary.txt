2022.10.22: the problem that was found is that list when it is predefined will add elements to it when it is needed, but will make a prbllem when tryting to move the point when a gap is found to move the points forward, as it throw error "outof index" so to make it right, I had to make a predefiened list with 800 element enside of it that they are all zero's then before adding element, it will remove the specific zero at its place

Ended with problem in trying to figure out a way to fill the gap after the first wave (8ooPx) are generated as filling the gaps doesn't wok after it, problem with adding it to the function addPoint(), is that it will make it a recusrive function calling when it ends up in filling the gap with for loop

2022.10.23: Gap problem, say that the gap is over the limit of list (800Px), dealing with it before was just to make the gap limited to the end of list, so if the point is at index 797 and the gap is 10 (that means there will be an out of index at extra index 6) so it was just to make it limited to  (gap = DISPLAY_H - POINTS_I - 1) but the probem is that it wouldn't work on high scale when the amplitude gets higher.
to deal with it is to remoe the over-points in gap from the beginning of the list and add empty points of the smae amout at the end then make the index go back to the new index, back to the same example,
 it will remove 6 points from the beginning of list then add empty 6 points to the end, and shift the index to 6 points in the back so it stays with the new point
