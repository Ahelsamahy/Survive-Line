2022.10.22: the problem that was found is that list when it is predefined will add elements to it when it is needed, but will make a prbllem when tryting to move the point when a gap is found to move the points forward, as it throw error "outof index" so to make it right, I had to make a predefiened list with 800 element enside of it that they are all zero's then before adding element, it will remove the specific zero at its place
